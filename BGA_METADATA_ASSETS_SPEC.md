## 📐 Detailed Design Rules

### 1. Game Box (`box.png` — 280 × 280 PNG)
* **Background MUST be transparent**: BGA renders this box directly over different light/dark theme backgrounds. Any solid white bounding box will look unprofessional.
* **Abstract Games / Cotton Case Games (e.g., nestorgames)**:
  * For nestorgames titles without traditional chipboard boxes, BGA standards permit a stylized 3D circular emblem, pouch render, or circular badge with the game's distinctive logo/wordmark with a subtle drop shadow.
* **Drop Shadow**: A subtle, soft drop shadow around the box art is recommended to float over BGA's background.

### 2. Game Icon (`icon.png` — 50 × 50 PNG)
* **No Borders**: Never include a 1px artificial black or white frame.
* **High Contrast**: Must be readable down to 16×16 px in some responsive browser views.
* **Focus**: Crop directly onto the most iconic piece (e.g. the Omega Ω symbol, a Yavalath hex cluster, or a clan crest).

### 3. Game Banner (`banner.jpg` — 1920 × 556 JPG)
* **Safe Zone**: Center 1200 × 500 px. Keep key logos and artwork away from the extreme left/right edges as mobile responsive views crop horizontally.
* **Gradient / Readability**: BGA overlays white title text and buttons on top of the banner. Keep the center or bottom third slightly darkened or clean so text remains legible.

### 4. Publisher Logo (`publisher.png` — 280 × 280 PNG)
* Transparent background.
* Clean vector-rasterized logo of the publisher (e.g., nestorgames, Z-Man Games, Brettco).

## ⚠️ Important Rules for the `img/` Directory vs `metadata_assets/`
* Keep official metadata images in `metadata_assets/` in your repository.
* Do **NOT** put 1920×556 banners or promotional graphics into your BGA code's `img/` folder:
  * Every image inside `img/` is loaded into memory during the table preloader phase. Large non-gameplay images cause table creation lag or timeout errors.
  * Metadata assets are uploaded separately in the BGA Studio Web Control Panel.
